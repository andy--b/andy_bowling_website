				<h3>Case Study: Upgrading from Excel to SQL</h3>
				<h5><strong>For growing businesses, Microsoft Excel does a ton of things really well.</strong></h5>
				<p>At small scale, Excel can be a one-stop shop for scheduling, inventory management, 
				database operations, and custom report generation, all without demanding much technical knowledge from the user or spreadsheet architect. But what happens when 
				the business (and database) grows and workbook operations start to slow to a halt? (Estimates say this happens somewhere between 100,000 and 1,000,000 cells)</p>
				<p>I recently had the opportunity to work with a manufacturing client encountering this exact issue. Keeping in mind that they were generally happy with their 
				current Excel front-end (aside from the speed issues), I was challenged to build a robust, scalable back-end solution capable of handling millions of pieces of data.</p>
				<p>Python has three great modules to help accomplish these goals:</p>
				<p><strong>1. SQLite:</strong> For back-end management and large-scale database operations.
				<br>    <strong>2. NumPy:</strong> Pythonâ€™s famed matrix manipulation module, for fast data calculation.
				<br>    <strong>3. XLSXwriter:</strong> To generate beautiful analytics reports that are viewable and modifiable in Excel.</p>
				<p>Using Excel VBA modules to tie everything together, I was able to achieve a fast, scalable, modular solution that will survive well beyond the lifespan of a standard Excel workbook.</p>
